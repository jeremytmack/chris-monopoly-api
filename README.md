## Files

Here is a description and breakdown of the files in this project.

### server.js

server.js is where all the action happens.

Dependencies:

- lowdb - This is nothing more than a cheap way to manage data via a text file (db.json). This would ultimately be replaced with a proper database.
  - express - A library we use for a quick webserver to spin up.
