This is the server API for Chris' Monopoly App

## Server

Here is a description of the files in this API... (its tiny.)

server.js is where all the action happens.

Dependencies:

- lowdb - This is nothing more than a cheap way to manage data via a text file (db.json). This would ultimately be replaced with a proper database.
- express - A library we use for a quick webserver to spin up.
